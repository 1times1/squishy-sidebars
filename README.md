# Squishy Sidebars

A plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Edits the behaviour of the "file-explorer", "tag", and "search" view types so that 1) you can close them and 2) they can be dragged into the main workspace split.

Additional functionality includes removing auto-generated tabs when Obsidian first loads (e.g. the file explorer tab in the sidebar), and forcing all new tabs to be opened in the main split.

Installation: download `main.js` and `manifest.json` from the releases tab and put them in an empty folder in your vault's `.obsidian/plugins` directory.
